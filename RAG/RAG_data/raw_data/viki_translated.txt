[26/01/2025, 19:54:11] Barbara: But like this, no
[26/01/2025, 19:54:16] Barbara: I'll look in our faculty drive
[26/01/2025, 19:54:21] Barbara: Maybe there's something
[26/01/2025, 19:54:43] Viki 🌹: There's a very big chance I'll need it

[07/04/2025, 13:33:57] Barbara: Sounds good

[19/04/2025, 14:19:54] Viki 🌹: My beautiful, what's up???
Listen, my mom brought me this perfume to give you for your collection lol
[19/04/2025, 14:20:13] Barbara: Oh, that's vintage
[19/04/2025, 14:20:18] Barbara: I'm not crazy about it
[19/04/2025, 14:20:20] Barbara: 😅😅😅😅
[19/04/2025, 14:20:28] Viki 🌹: She said she doesn't really use it because the scent is too strong
And she doesn't want to throw it away and the bottle is cute
So if you want it for your collection
[19/04/2025, 14:21:38] Barbara: Bring it next time we go out for a walk, I'll try it lol
[19/04/2025, 14:21:42] Barbara: Maybe I'll like it
[19/04/2025, 14:21:48] Barbara: It's a style, but I think it's like Chanel 5
[19/04/2025, 14:21:53] Barbara: Which is really old school
[19/05/2025, 15:12:35] Viki 🌹: Cool
In general, if you know someone who might be interested
Or if you want it for your collection anyway, then with love ❤️
[19/05/2025, 13:14:18] Viki 🌹: My beautifullllll

‎<This message was edited>
[29/05/2025, 16:59:33] Viki 🌹: I missed you ❤️❤️
[13/06/2025, 20:30:06] Viki 🌹: My beautiful
[13/06/2025, 20:30:13] Viki 🌹: I wanted to ask how you are?
How are you with the situation?
[13/06/2025, 21:22:27] Barbara: So so
[13/06/2025, 21:22:30] Barbara: Stuck at home
[13/06/2025, 21:22:39] Barbara: It's a bummer that the routine was disrupted, but overall everything is pretty calm
[13/06/2025, 21:24:14] Barbara: How about you?
[13/06/2025, 21:24:17] Barbara: Is everything okay?
[13/06/2025, 21:24:43] Barbara: I'm very happy that we took out all their nuclear ammunition like that
[13/06/2025, 21:29:32] Viki 🌹: That's right!!
[13/06/2025, 21:29:56] Viki 🌹: Thank God, I'm fine
We're not too stressed
But we also don't go out on purpose, like that
[13/06/2025, 21:31:13] Barbara: Actually, I just checked the news and saw there were about 7 falls
[13/06/2025, 21:31:31] Viki 🌹: Yes, in the Gush Dan area
[13/06/2025, 21:31:40] Viki 🌹: And there's another barrage on the way
[13/06/2025, 21:31:53] Barbara: Yes, I saw
[13/06/2025, 21:31:55] Barbara: It's fine
[13/06/2025, 21:32:09] Barbara: The main thing is that these alerts work so well
[13/06/2025, 21:38:15] Viki 🌹: Too well
[15/06/2025, 19:08:50] Barbara: Ugh, I can't talk
[15/06/2025, 19:09:12] Viki 🌹: What happened? Is everything okay?
[15/06/2025, 19:09:25] Barbara: Yes, I wanted to suggest a walk with the dogsss
[15/06/2025, 19:09:26] Viki 🌹: I took advantage of the quiet a bit
To shower lol
Before the madness
[15/06/2025, 19:09:35] Viki 🌹: Did you already go out?
[15/06/2025, 19:09:40] Barbara: Yesnn
[15/06/2025, 19:09:44] Barbara: But I can wait
[15/06/2025, 19:09:49] Barbara: I'm taking a one-hour walk
[15/06/2025, 19:11:18] Viki 🌹: Are you planning to be out for an hour or have you been out for an hour already?
[15/06/2025, 19:13:43] Barbara: Oh
[15/06/2025, 19:13:45] Barbara: Planning
[15/06/2025, 19:13:47] Barbara: I just went out
[15/06/2025, 19:13:53] Viki 🌹: OMG an hour lolll
[15/06/2025, 19:14:06] Barbara: I can't hear
[15/06/2025, 19:14:08] Barbara: 🥺
[15/06/2025, 19:14:11] Viki 🌹: Oh wait
[15/06/2025, 19:14:47] Viki 🌹: Okay, so since Tuesday I've had pain in my left leg, I don't know if it's tight twin muscles or stretched, but it limits me in walking and I walk really slowly, until yesterday evening I was limping, today I'm walking reasonably but just very slowly, take that into account ‎<This message was edited>
[15/06/2025, 19:15:12] Barbara: Ahhh, I didn't mean that we should walk
[15/06/2025, 19:15:21] Barbara: We can just sit in that circle area
[15/06/2025, 19:15:33] Barbara: Because it's also advisable to be close to a shelter
[15/06/2025, 19:15:50] Viki 🌹: No problem, I'll get ready and we can go out
[15/06/2025, 19:16:00] Viki 🌹: I usually just didn't go too far from home
[15/06/2025, 19:16:12] Barbara: Legitimate
[15/06/2025, 19:16:15] Barbara: On the contrary, it makes sense
[15/06/2025, 19:16:22] Viki 🌹: Because it hurts me to move 🥲
[15/06/2025, 19:16:50] Viki 🌹: Shit, wait
[15/06/2025, 19:17:17] Barbara: Listen, it's a war after all
[15/06/2025, 19:17:46] Viki 🌹: Something to consider if we want to be here in our garden, which is very possible, like Shugi always wanted to be here, and even if inspectors pass by, no one ever says anything because it's like, it's a garden connected to the building
But there's a small "but" here, we have neighbors here and they have a small dog, a Miniature Pinscher, and she will be inside the shelter if something happens
[15/06/2025, 19:18:06] Barbara: I meant, is the circle area not good?
[15/06/2025, 19:18:13] Barbara: Because I do want to let Gray run around
[15/06/2025, 19:18:17] Viki 🌹: Is there a shelter in that area?
[15/06/2025, 19:18:21] Barbara: Yes
[15/06/2025, 19:18:25] Barbara: There's a building opposite
[15/06/2025, 19:18:32] Barbara: Your neighbors'
[15/06/2025, 19:18:46] Viki 🌹: Practically, practically they give a warning of about 10 minutes, so it's reasonable
[15/06/2025, 19:19:17] Viki 🌹: Maybe you want to go to the Napoleon area?
Downstairs, of course
[15/06/2025, 19:19:38] Viki 🌹: Those also, they have Mati who is problematic...
[15/06/2025, 19:32:05] Barbara: ‎Video call, ‎No answer
[15/06/2025, 20:32:09] Viki 🌹: Wait, when did you say your birthday is?
This Tuesday or next Tuesday?

I love you sooooo muchhhhhh.
You are a walking sun that radiates only light, joy, and endless love!!!
I wish you lots of fun time to spend with your beloved for a change.
I wish Shugi would listen to you and stop running into the bushes and that she would continue to be such a princess who only loves you!
I wish you a year of victories, success, without re-exams or retaking courses.
A promotion at work, that everyone knows and appreciates you because you are truly perfect!!
Oh, and of course, may your knee pain stop (come on, we're not at the age for those kinds of blessings yet 🤭🤭🤭)

Just kidding, I'm absolutely crazy about you, thank you for always being accepting and understanding, always being there to listen, and always coming with the funniest stories.
I, and everyone around you, are incredibly lucky to have you ❤️
[13/07/2025, 1:52:21] Barbara: I truly apologize for being an idiot, I didn't realize we were already in July 😓

[29/07/2025, 10:44:59] Barbara: Because she couldn't even fly to say goodbye
[29/07/2025, 10:45:20] Barbara: And in general, she hadn't seen her for almost 15 years...
[29/07/2025, 10:45:25] Barbara: How are you?
How is Matan?

I just had an unusual drop in hemoglobin, so before anything happens, I preferred to come and check everything, everything that's needed
I hope they release me in a day or two 🤞🏼
[27/08/2025, 11:24:54] Barbara: My lifeeeee, sorry

[01/11/2025, 10:53:22] Barbara: You kind of run a program in your head and go line by line what happens with each of the variables and literally write it down
[01/11/2025, 10:53:53] Barbara: I mean, first iteration:
And then go line by line, write down what happened with the variables in each line
And then second iteration and so on
[01/11/2025, 10:54:20] Barbara: In recursion questions it's a little different but the same principle, the difference is that there you need to identify a pattern

[02/11/2025, 14:02:14] Viki 🌹: Basically, I try to write the codes on paper
To practice that
Because the exam will be on paper lolll, I need to work on that already 😂
[02/11/2025, 14:04:16] Barbara: Of course, I just asked if you check things with it and stuff
[02/11/2025, 14:13:29] Viki 🌹: Oh, yes, I do
It's really convenient
