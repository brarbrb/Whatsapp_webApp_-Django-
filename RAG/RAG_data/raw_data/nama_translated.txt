[25/11/2019, 21:16:32] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: I know
[04/12/2019, 13:39:38] Barbara: Hi guys, is there anyone who can come for my shift today?
I will return the favor during the week/next week. I received an urgent referral to the hospital and definitely won't be able to finish before the shift starts
[04/12/2019, 13:40:26] Barbara: Hi Naama, maybe you can? (And yes I did, I just did the business from the group :)
[04/12/2019, 13:46:20] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: hahahahahah
[04/12/2019, 13:46:25] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: One second, I'm checking

[04/12/2019, 13:48:51] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: From Nahariya??!
[04/12/2019, 13:49:02] Barbara: Yes
[04/12/2019, 13:49:23] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: Okay, let's go
[04/12/2019, 13:49:29] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: I'll switch with you
[04/12/2019, 13:49:34] Barbara: Okay, I'll send a message to Shirel
[04/12/2019, 13:49:39] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: But unfortunately I really need a ride because I won't make the public transport
[04/12/2019, 13:50:09] Barbara: That's not a problem for me, it's a 20 minute drive for me one way
[04/12/2019, 13:50:31] Barbara: In the meantime, I'll also have time to eat and change clothes lol
[04/12/2019, 13:50:49] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: I'm changing too
[04/12/2019, 14:06:59] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: I don't mind being late either
[04/12/2019, 14:07:04] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: So don't worry
[04/12/2019, 14:08:51] Barbara: Yeah and then I'm the one who's blamed lol
[04/12/2019, 14:19:30] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: Why would you be blamed
[04/12/2019, 14:19:35] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: I'm always late for the middle shift
[04/12/2019, 14:19:40] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: I don't have public transport on time
[04/12/2019, 14:32:38] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: The Iris 15 is the address

[29/12/2019, 20:36:54] Barbara: And don't ask why and what
[29/12/2019, 20:37:09] Barbara: I've been angry about it all day
[29/12/2019, 20:46:17] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: I don't understand
[29/12/2019, 20:46:21] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: I'm there alone?
[29/12/2019, 20:46:22] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: Why
[29/12/2019, 20:46:25] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: Based on what
[29/12/2019, 21:36:22] Barbara: Do you think they'll let you be there alone?
[29/12/2019, 21:36:26] Barbara: On New Year's Eve?
[29/12/2019, 21:37:34] Barbara: Based on the fact that it's the only holiday we celebrate as a family since I made Aliyah.
Based on the fact that I told her two weeks ago I wouldn't be here on that date.
[29/12/2019, 22:22:13] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: Oh, oops, I was afraid you wanted to work and they got you stuck
[29/12/2019, 22:22:20] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: What a bummer
[29/12/2019, 22:22:26] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: Of course you should stay with the family
[29/12/2019, 22:22:30] Barbara: Oh no
[29/12/2019, 22:22:32] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: It's Novy God
[29/12/2019, 22:22:35] Barbara: Right
[29/12/2019, 22:33:21] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: Great, I'm happy that you're celebrating as you should
[05/01/2020, 17:42:13] Barbara: Naama, tell me, did you open up the whole week for Shirel or are you busy?
[05/01/2020, 17:42:44] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: Why are you asking?
[05/01/2020, 17:42:49] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: I didn't open everything for her
[05/01/2020, 17:42:54] Barbara: Just curious lol
[05/01/2020, 17:43:00] Barbara: They gave me 5 shifts this week
[05/01/2020, 17:43:03] Barbara: which is good
[05/01/2020, 17:43:04] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: But they really annoyed me
[05/01/2020, 17:43:08] Barbara: That's money I really need
[05/01/2020, 17:43:10] Barbara: Why?
[05/01/2020, 17:43:14] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: Well, great
[05/01/2020, 17:43:15] Barbara: With the message she sent
[05/01/2020, 17:43:19] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: What's up with that thing
[05/01/2020, 17:43:18] Barbara: ?

[05/01/2020, 17:43:39] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: Just stupid
[05/01/2020, 17:43:44] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: Me neither
[05/01/2020, 17:43:49] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: It feels really childish to me
[05/01/2020, 17:44:00] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: They probably got mad that they gave conditions

[31/05/2020, 16:12:33] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: Really
[31/05/2020, 16:12:38] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: Not worth the time and gas
[31/05/2020, 16:12:38] Barbara: If there isn't a second wave now, I'll probably really leave for there
[31/05/2020, 16:12:43] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: And they annoy me
[31/05/2020, 16:12:47] Barbara: It's okay, there's hardly any gas
[31/05/2020, 16:12:56] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: hahahahaha
[31/05/2020, 16:12:57] Barbara: Did they give you trouble about leaving?
[31/05/2020, 16:13:00] Barbara: Did they say anything?
[31/05/2020, 16:13:09] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: They can't say anything
[31/05/2020, 16:13:13] Barbara: Of course
[31/05/2020, 16:13:14] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: I left during unpaid leave
[31/05/2020, 16:13:20] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: And honestly, it's just waitressing
[31/05/2020, 16:13:26] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: It's not a job with a future here
[31/05/2020, 16:13:33] Barbara: You just wrote that they annoy you
[31/05/2020, 16:13:37] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: I also decided not to return there as a customer
[31/05/2020, 16:13:38] Barbara: Of course
[31/05/2020, 16:13:43] Barbara: Wow
[31/05/2020, 16:13:49] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: Because they are disgusting, that's why they annoyed me
[31/05/2020, 16:13:50] Barbara: Even though you were so happy with their food
[31/05/2020, 16:13:55] Barbara: I understand lolll
[31/05/2020, 16:14:01] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: They are very disrespectful of my money and my family's money
[31/05/2020, 16:14:07] Barbara: Yes, you said once
[31/05/2020, 16:14:13] Barbara: That they think it comes easily to them
[31/05/2020, 16:14:21] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: And I don't see any reason to give it to them after how they spoke about us 
[31/05/2020, 16:14:21] Barbara: And actually, they work like donkeys for the money
[31/05/2020, 16:14:31] Barbara: What what what wait
[31/05/2020, 16:14:34] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: Yes, I left with a bad taste

[31/05/2020, 16:15:57] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: He said it's a good thing there are no cameras and that if he didn't have a wife he would do me
[31/05/2020, 16:16:06] Barbara: Whattttt
[31/05/2020, 16:16:12] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: I considered quitting
[31/05/2020, 16:16:18] Barbara: Just joking

[31/05/2020, 16:16:24] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: He said that to Lara and Lulu too
[31/05/2020, 16:16:28] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: No, no
[31/05/2020, 16:16:28] Barbara: Real harassment
[31/05/2020, 16:16:32] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: He wasn't joking
[31/05/2020, 16:16:35] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: You didn't hear his tone
[31/05/2020, 16:16:35] Barbara: Whattttt?!?!?
[31/05/2020, 16:16:39] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: He was completely serious

[31/05/2020, 16:17:11] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: No problem
[31/05/2020, 16:17:20] Barbara: I just said he once joked with Shirel about his tongue, I don't know what
[31/05/2020, 16:17:27] Barbara: I thought it was the same style
[31/05/2020, 16:17:29] Barbara: Pizdets
[31/05/2020, 16:17:31] Barbara: I'm in shock

[31/05/2020, 16:18:37] Barbara: Idiot
[31/05/2020, 16:18:38] Barbara: Really
[31/05/2020, 16:18:52] Barbara: Well, maybe his dad didn't help him
[31/05/2020, 16:19:00] Naama🧚🏻‍♀️: I want it to end so we can meet
[31/05/2020, 16:19:02] Barbara: But still, that doesn't give him the right to behave like that
