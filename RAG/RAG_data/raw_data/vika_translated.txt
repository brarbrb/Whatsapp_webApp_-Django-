[16/02/2020, 16:07:16] Barbara: I didn't think it was at the end of the month

[16/02/2020, 16:11:24] Barbara: That's not a split personality
[16/02/2020, 16:11:33] Barbara: You just always manage to see both sides of the coin

[16/02/2020, 16:13:24] Barbara: The problem with it is that no one ever understands us
[16/02/2020, 16:13:32] Barbara: But the most amazing women are Pisces and Gemini
[16/02/2020, 16:13:35] Barbara: I swear to you
[16/02/2020, 16:13:44] Barbara: But men of those signs are just garbage
[16/02/2020, 16:13:53] Barbara: I only knew one Gemini man who was good
[16/02/2020, 16:14:07] Vika⭐️: I like it too, especially that my mood can change in a second

[16/02/2020, 16:20:19] Vika⭐️: What mainly deters me is that it needs to be maintained pretty regularly
[16/02/2020, 16:20:26] Vika⭐️: Once a year or two max
[16/02/2020, 16:20:50] Vika⭐️: Perfect, they really do it subtly, but it's expensiveee

[12/03/2020, 23:05:24] Barbara: Sort of
[12/03/2020, 23:05:34] Barbara: She probably won't expect a gift from me
[12/03/2020, 23:05:41] Barbara: Oh no, even though I gave her one last year
[12/03/2020, 23:48:28] Vika⭐️: Hahaha, whatever you want
[12/03/2020, 23:48:51] Vika⭐️: Regarding the family, she just asked them to give her money
[12/03/2020, 23:49:45] Vika⭐️: The things she likes are clothes at Zara, buying things for the house, ordering Kylie Jenner makeup
[14/03/2020, 22:23:48] Vika⭐️: Barbara
[14/03/2020, 22:23:59] Vika⭐️: Seriously, did you do the Corona test now?
[14/03/2020, 22:24:06] Vika⭐️: If yes, I'll report it to my commander
[14/03/2020, 22:25:53] Barbara: Yesnnn

[18/03/2020, 12:22:52] Barbara: Okay
[18/03/2020, 12:22:57] Barbara: Going a bit crazy here
[18/03/2020, 12:23:02] Barbara: How about you?
[18/03/2020, 12:23:18] Vika⭐️: Going crazy myself🤯
[18/03/2020, 12:23:47] Vika⭐️: And it's Milina's birthday on Friday 😣 I don't know how to cheer her up, I don't even have a way to buy her balloons
[18/03/2020, 12:33:58] Barbara: What, aren't there any in the stores?
[18/03/2020, 12:34:11] Barbara: Are you also staying home?
[18/03/2020, 12:34:28] Vika⭐️: I'm not allowed to leave the house except for the base and only by car, not public transport
[18/03/2020, 12:34:48] Barbara: You say that as if public transport is really fun for you
[18/03/2020, 12:35:12] Barbara: And why aren't you allowed?
I mean, you are allowed to leave the house, it's just not recommended
[18/03/2020, 12:35:24] Vika⭐️: Public transport is my option for getting around because I don't have a car
[18/03/2020, 12:35:32] Vika⭐️: Not allowed because I'm in the army
[18/03/2020, 12:35:41] Vika⭐️: It's not a recommendation lolll

[06/05/2020, 17:52:18] Barbara: 😂😂😊🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
[06/05/2020, 17:52:26] Barbara: It's okay, not critical
[06/05/2020, 17:52:37] Barbara: Wow, but the person who does yours does it really well
[06/05/2020, 17:52:41] Barbara: Really subtle
[06/05/2020, 17:52:47] Vika⭐️: Say thank you every morning!
[06/05/2020, 17:52:53] Barbara: Yeah, right
[06/05/2020, 17:52:55] Vika⭐️: She's amazing
[06/05/2020, 17:53:02] Barbara: I wake up and go, don't need to draw anything on my face
[06/05/2020, 17:53:11] Barbara: Except for a little mascara
[06/05/2020, 17:53:22] Barbara: But that's all of us
[06/05/2020, 17:53:25] Vika⭐️: It took me a while to find her and then I followed her for about a year and something on Instagram and only then did I go and get it done
[06/05/2020, 17:53:35] Barbara: Were you scared?
[06/05/2020, 17:53:53] Barbara: Send me her Instagram link for a minute
[06/05/2020, 17:54:08] Vika⭐️: Listen, yes, a little scary that it might suddenly turn out crooked or not suit the shape, but I was pretty calm
[08/05/2020, 18:48:27] Vika⭐️: Milina is sleeping
[08/05/2020, 18:48:37] Barbara: Oopsieeee

[08/05/2020, 18:50:11] Barbara: Oh, no, oh, why did I eat 🤦🏼‍♀️😭
[08/05/2020, 18:50:34] Barbara: I made pasta with hummus and it's the most inedible thing on earth
[08/05/2020, 18:50:38] Vika⭐️: We'll probably do it towards the evening
[08/05/2020, 18:50:47] Vika⭐️: Until then you'll be hungry again
[08/05/2020, 18:50:52] Barbara: Amen

[08/05/2020, 18:51:26] Barbara: I'm exhausted from the workout, honestly
[08/05/2020, 18:51:32] Barbara: In another hour-hour and a half
[08/05/2020, 18:51:41] Vika⭐️: Okay 👍🏼

[09/05/2020, 17:58:14] Barbara: We'll be there in another quarter of an hour

[09/05/2020, 18:31:49] Barbara: I think you'll arrive before us
[09/05/2020, 18:32:13] Barbara: 🤦🏼‍♀️🤣
[10/05/2020, 22:08:20] Vika⭐️: Hi sweetie, do you want a cabin next weekend to celebrate the end of Corona?
It's basically Milina, me, and 4 other friends from Karmiel
[10/05/2020, 22:08:32] Vika⭐️: You know Avital, she's the one from Eilat lolll
[10/05/2020, 22:17:14] Barbara: Oh, I don't know
[10/05/2020, 22:17:29] Barbara: Which days do you want?
[10/05/2020, 22:22:15] Vika⭐️: Friday Saturday
[10/05/2020, 22:29:50] Barbara: When are you finalizing it?
‎[10/05/2020, 22:29:57] Barbara: ‎audio omitted
[10/05/2020, 22:30:36] Vika⭐️: Ummm, basically we want to finalize it this week
‎[10/05/2020, 22:31:37] Barbara: ‎audio omitted
[10/05/2020, 23:12:33] Vika⭐️: So yes, we do need to know the number because most cabins are for 5 people and if you come we need to look and check for 6
[11/05/2020, 12:55:22] Barbara: How much does it cost approximately?
[11/05/2020, 12:55:31] Barbara: Up to how many hundreds of shekels?
[11/05/2020, 12:55:50] Vika⭐️: Something like that, yes
[11/05/2020, 12:56:06] Barbara: No, but up to how much??? lolll
[11/05/2020, 12:56:07] Vika⭐️: But there's a chance it won't happen because we have no one to leave Kendall with
[11/05/2020, 16:48:13] Barbara: Okay, I don't know for sure.
I just paid the car test fee and I also have a 500 fine to pay. And I also didn't receive any money from the National Insurance Institute this month
[11/05/2020, 16:48:28] Barbara: So I really don't know what to tell you
[11/05/2020, 16:49:58] Barbara: I've just never been to a cabin so I have no idea how much it costs approximately
[11/05/2020, 18:09:52] Vika⭐️: I can't tell you exactly, but in any case it probably won't happen because of Kendall
[11/05/2020, 18:10:07] Barbara: 😐
[11/05/2020, 18:10:25] Barbara: Listen, if you do end up going and I don't, I can take her
[11/05/2020, 18:10:27] Barbara: Her
[11/05/2020, 18:10:32] Barbara: Oh, wait, wait, no
[11/05/2020, 18:10:44] Barbara: If I don't go with you, I'll probably be at Willy's
[11/05/2020, 18:10:46] Barbara: Because it's the weekend
[11/05/2020, 18:10:54] Barbara: *with you (plural)
[11/05/2020, 18:11:01] Vika⭐️: It's just for her to change houses and get used to it, she's still small
[11/05/2020, 18:11:22] Barbara: I don't think one day will affect her somehow
[11/05/2020, 18:11:31] Barbara: But yes, she'll probably just be a little shocked
[11/05/2020, 18:11:48] Vika⭐️: She's small still, I don't want to drive her crazy
[23/05/2020, 20:36:23] Barbara: Vikushhhh
[23/05/2020, 20:36:31] Barbara: What's the name of the game you let me play this morning?!

[24/09/2025, 17:04:07] Barbara: I understood it's no more expensive than 100 shekels
[24/09/2025, 17:04:14] Barbara: Don't look specifically
[24/09/2025, 17:04:16] Vika⭐️: Do you know how much it's supposed to cost
[24/09/2025, 17:04:20] Barbara: I have tons of makeup lolll
[24/09/2025, 17:04:26] Vika⭐️: Hahahahaha
[24/09/2025, 17:04:29] Barbara: Something like $20
[24/09/2025, 17:04:39] Vika⭐️: 👌🏼👌🏼
[24/09/2025, 17:04:43] Barbara: Only if you happen to pass by and see it
[24/09/2025, 17:04:53] Barbara: By chance
[24/09/2025, 17:04:57] Vika⭐️: Did you park outside?
[24/09/2025, 17:05:10] Vika⭐️: Because honestly our parking spot is empty
[24/09/2025, 17:05:13] Barbara: If it's really not more expensive than 100₪ then buy it, I'll transfer everything to you
[24/09/2025, 17:05:18] Barbara: Yes
[24/09/2025, 17:05:22] Barbara: Actually there were spots
[24/09/2025, 17:05:25] Vika⭐️: Okay
[24/09/2025, 17:05:32] Barbara: Yes, but it's probably a hassle to get into it
[24/09/2025, 17:06:01] Barbara: No?
[24/09/2025, 17:06:12] Vika⭐️: Maybe the app will work for me remotely
[24/09/2025, 17:06:21] Vika⭐️: I've never tried, honestly
[24/09/2025, 17:06:30] Barbara: No, leave it
[24/09/2025, 17:06:31] Vika⭐️: And to exit it opens automatically

[24/09/2025, 17:10:05] Vika⭐️: Yes, for calming
If she's driving you crazy, she has catnip spray (it's small, next to the spice shelf) you can spray it on one of her toys and then she'll get horny with it

She also has a red box (I think on the counter or where the coffee is) that has cornflake-like pillows.
You can take her with that to the safe room at night. Put about 6-7 in a bowl
[26/09/2025, 15:59:26] Vika⭐️: No, it was his sister who left an apartment with a roommate and they bought the couch together and after a year they split up so we paid about 1200₪ for it, I think
[26/09/2025, 15:59:32] Vika⭐️: Maybe less even

[26/09/2025, 17:31:02] Barbara: I replaced the water there when I left
[26/09/2025, 17:31:19] Barbara: I read what you wrote about the fridge

[07/10/2025, 15:45:42] Vika⭐️: Tel Aviv is unnecessary
[07/10/2025, 15:45:42] Barbara: Actually, I don't care
[07/10/2025, 15:45:48] Barbara: Really
[07/10/2025, 15:45:48] Vika⭐️: I don't like that city
[07/10/2025, 15:45:56] Barbara: I mean, we can go somewhere that's not in Haifa
[07/10/2025, 15:46:09] Barbara: I don't mind driving if you wanted a place you hadn't been to and stuff
[07/10/2025, 15:46:21] Vika⭐️: There's a great bar

[07/10/2025, 15:46:31] Vika⭐️: I don't know if they're open today, we can check

[07/10/2025, 16:15:22] Barbara: Okay, Regie is upset because something isn't working there, some program, and he was working on it until morning and is still working on it now, so he probably can't make it
[07/10/2025, 16:15:27] Barbara: 🫠

[15/10/2025, 1:15:24] Barbara: Wow, Vikush, tell me, didn't you find the charging cable?
Maybe it's under the couch because that's where I charged it last time before I switched to a different cable, or maybe I shoved it somewhere in the cabinet under the TV just out of stupidity?
😭 I'm suffering with my old charger lolll
[15/10/2025, 1:15:45] Barbara: And I can't find the cable in any of my bags
