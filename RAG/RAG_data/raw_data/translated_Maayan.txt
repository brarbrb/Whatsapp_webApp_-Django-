[01/13/2025, 12:49:06] Barbara: Hi, sweetheart.
[01/13/2025, 12:49:06] Barbara: Tell me, do you happen to have a reference for a bonus question on Homework 5 in Statistics 2 to share with a good friend 🥲
[01/13/2025, 21:25:08] Barbara: Sweethearrrrrt, no problem, ignore it
[01/13/2025, 21:25:20] Maayan Sade: I broke up with my girlfriend today
[01/13/2025, 21:25:20] Barbara: By any chance, could you replace me face-to-face on Wednesday?
[01/13/2025, 21:25:23] Maayan Sade: That's the excuse
[01/13/2025, 21:25:25] Maayan Sade: Ummmmm
[01/13/2025, 21:25:27] Maayan Sade: Doubt it
[01/13/2025, 21:25:31] Barbara: Oh no, sorryyyyy
[01/13/2025, 21:25:33] Maayan Sade: In Karmiel?
[01/13/2025, 21:25:36] Barbara: No
[01/13/2025, 21:25:36] Maayan Sade: Ask Itay
[01/13/2025, 21:25:37] Barbara: In Haifa
[01/13/2025, 21:25:38] Barbara: For 10th grade (Yud)
[01/13/2025, 21:25:40] Maayan Sade: Ah in Haifa
[01/13/2025, 21:25:44] Maayan Sade: Possible then
[01/13/2025, 21:25:49] Maayan Sade: Although I don't know
[01/13/2025, 21:25:49] Barbara: Keep me updated
[01/13/2025, 21:25:52] Maayan Sade: I will update you
[01/13/2025, 21:26:00] Barbara: By tomorrow please
[01/13/2025, 21:26:07] Maayan Sade: What's the rush
[01/13/2025, 21:26:10] Barbara: If you really don't feel like it, it's okay
[01/13/2025, 21:26:20] Barbara: Wait, are you an instructor for 10th (Yud) or 11th (Yud-Aleph)?
[01/13/2025, 21:26:21] Barbara: ?
[01/13/2025, 21:26:26] Maayan Sade: 11th (Yud-Aleph)
[01/13/2025, 21:26:28] Maayan Sade: 🪓
[01/13/2025, 21:26:29] Barbara: Ahhhhhh
[01/13/2025, 21:26:31] Barbara: Okay never mind
[01/13/2025, 21:26:36] Barbara: Why are you in the 10th grade group
[01/13/2025, 21:26:38] Maayan Sade: Hahahahahahahahahaha
[01/13/2025, 21:26:44] Maayan Sade: Don't ask questions, you won't hear lies
[01/13/2025, 21:26:57] Maayan Sade: I'm also in the Moodle and Drive of 10th grade
[01/13/2025, 21:26:59] Barbara: Good, darling, feel better
[01/13/2025, 21:27:00] Maayan Sade: Infiltrator
[01/13/2025, 21:27:03] Barbara: There are many fish in the sea
[01/13/2025, 21:27:06] Barbara: Even when you think there aren't
[01/13/2025, 21:27:08] Barbara: Turns out there are
[01/13/2025, 21:27:09] Maayan Sade: Yes
[01/13/2025, 21:27:12] Maayan Sade: ❤️🫂
[01/13/2025, 21:27:49] Barbara: If it makes you feel better, my ex, with whom we were supposed to sign on an apartment, broke up with me (we were together for a long time) and that same
[01/13/2025, 21:27:49] Barbara: evening was on a date with someone else
[01/13/2025, 21:27:58] Barbara: That was six months ago
[01/13/2025, 21:28:02] Maayan Sade: 😨
[01/13/2025, 21:28:05] Maayan Sade: Oh my god
[01/13/2025, 21:28:10] Barbara: Today I'm already with a prince charming I couldn't have dreamed of
[01/13/2025, 21:28:15] Maayan Sade: Molotov cocktail to his apartment
[01/13/2025, 21:28:18] Barbara: That's why I wrote it
[01/13/2025, 21:28:20] Barbara: Hahah
[01/13/2025, 21:28:29] Maayan Sade: Honestly, inspiring
[01/13/2025, 21:28:45] Barbara: True, I seriously considered slashing his car tires (he's really obsessed with his car) but I let it go
[01/13/2025, 21:28:55] Maayan Sade: Fair
[01/13/2025, 21:29:01] Maayan Sade: (That is indeed a crime)
[01/13/2025, 21:29:08] Maayan Sade: What would the students say
[cite_start][01/13/2025, 21:29:09] Barbara: Yes, hearing such stories really helped me too [cite: 8] so here I shared mine
[01/13/2025, 21:29:13] Barbara: I wish you a speedy recovery from it
[01/13/2025, 21:29:15] Maayan Sade: Yes
[01/13/2025, 21:29:20] Maayan Sade: The truth is, it's not close at all
[01/13/2025, 21:29:23] Maayan Sade: It was me who broke up with her
[01/13/2025, 21:29:28] Barbara: It's okay
[01/13/2025, 21:29:29] Maayan Sade: But it just had to happen
[01/13/2025, 21:29:31] Barbara: That's not easier sometimes
[01/13/2025, 21:29:34] Barbara: Good
[01/13/2025, 21:29:37] Barbara: Don't feel bad
[01/13/2025, 21:29:39] Maayan Sade: It really wasn't
[01/13/2025, 21:29:42] Maayan Sade: I don't feel bad
[01/13/2025, 21:29:44] Maayan Sade: I feel sad
[01/13/2025, 21:29:46] Maayan Sade: Because it's sad
[01/13/2025, 21:29:52] Maayan Sade: We love each other very much
[01/13/2025, 21:29:53] Maayan Sade: It was hard
[01/13/2025, 21:29:57] Maayan Sade: 
[01/13/2025, 21:29:57] Maayan Sade: The second
[01/13/2025, 21:30:00] Maayan Sade: Not the other
[01/13/2025, 21:30:06] Maayan Sade: You get it
[01/13/2025, 21:30:08] Barbara: Yes, yes
[01/13/2025, 21:30:14] Barbara: Love is really not enough
[01/13/2025, 21:30:17] Barbara: You need everything together
[01/13/2025, 21:30:20] Maayan Sade: Yes
[01/13/2025, 21:30:25] Barbara: And it truly exists, it takes time to find..
[01/13/2025, 21:30:36] Maayan Sade: Yes
[01/13/2025, 21:30:39] Maayan Sade: Sad
[01/13/2025, 21:30:40] Maayan Sade: Year and a half
[01/13/2025, 21:30:42] Maayan Sade: Not easy
[01/13/2025, 21:31:00] Barbara: Definitely sad...
[01/13/2025, 21:31:18] Barbara: Sink into it a bit and then immediately snap out of that mood forcefully
[01/13/2025, 21:31:22] Maayan Sade: Yes
[01/13/2025, 21:31:27] Maayan Sade: Exam period
[01/13/2025, 21:31:28] Maayan Sade: No choice
[01/13/2025, 21:31:34] Barbara: Even a bit before
[01/13/2025, 21:31:36] Maayan Sade: Technion 🥵😍✨
[01/13/2025, 21:31:43] Barbara: Yeeessss tell me about it..
[01/13/2025, 21:31:44] Barbara: Never mind
[01/13/2025, 21:31:53] Maayan Sade: Truly horrible
[01/13/2025, 21:32:08] Barbara: After about a week/two weeks try to start seeing the positive things about being single compared to being in a relationship that isn't good for you
[01/13/2025, 21:32:11] Maayan Sade: Anyway, I'm now stuffing myself with snacks and ice cream and trying to comfort myself
[01/13/2025, 21:32:15] Maayan Sade: There are many
[01/13/2025, 21:32:21] Barbara: So good
[01/13/2025, 21:32:25] Barbara: It should give you strength
[01/13/2025, 21:33:36] Maayan Sade: audio omitted
[01/13/2025, 21:34:16] Barbara: Doesn't sound like you were very much in love with her
[01/13/2025, 21:34:25] Barbara: Like maybe it's bad of me to say that
[01/13/2025, 21:34:41] Barbara: But true love only gives strength
[01/13/2025, 21:34:47] Barbara: Really
[01/13/2025, 21:34:53] Barbara: It's the safe place
[01/13/2025, 21:35:27] Maayan Sade: Damn
[01/13/2025, 21:35:43] Maayan Sade: I respectfully but firmly disagree
[01/13/2025, 21:36:06] Barbara: Not saying you didn't love her, just that it's not "it"
[01/13/2025, 21:36:11] Barbara: It's not *the* love
[01/13/2025, 21:36:24] Maayan Sade: 🤷🏻‍♂️
[01/13/2025, 21:36:27] Maayan Sade: We'll agree to disagree
[03/06/2025, 19:12:14] Maayan Sade: Secret 🤫
[03/06/2025, 19:12:46] Barbara: Nooooo what does that mean though
[03/06/2025, 19:12:54] Maayan Sade: I have no clue either
[03/06/2025, 19:12:58] Maayan Sade: It made me laugh though
[03/06/2025, 19:15:29] Barbara: Thanks for the help
[03/06/2025, 19:16:47] Maayan Sade: 🫠
[03/06/2025, 19:16:49] Maayan Sade: Forgive me
[09/03/2025, 22:09:08] Maayan Sade: I don't belieeeeeeve that's what the dean of our faculty is saying
[09/03/2025, 22:09:09] Maayan Sade: What a disgrace
[09/03/2025, 22:46:23] Barbara: Yes yes, I saw that despicable article
[09/03/2025, 22:46:28] Barbara: Ran sent it on Friday
[09/03/2025, 22:46:30] Barbara: I was in shooockkkk
[09/03/2025, 22:46:36] Barbara: I didn't expect such a low level
[09/03/2025, 22:46:44] Maayan Sade: It's just a disgrace
[09/03/2025, 22:47:06] Barbara: Yap…
[09/03/2025, 22:47:58] Maayan Sade: Every time I'm surprised anew how low the Technion can sink
[09/03/2025, 22:52:02] Maayan Sade: What's good though is Yair's response
[09/03/2025, 22:52:04] Maayan Sade: Wow, kingggking
[10/03/2025, 0:55:50] Barbara: Really
[10/03/2025, 0:56:06] Barbara: I enjoyed reading that response
[10/03/2025, 1:34:05] Maayan Sade: Yes it's very satisfying that someone from the staff and an instructor at that understands how bizarre this situation is
[17/03/2025, 14:26:35] Barbara: Maayan with the regression
[17/03/2025, 14:26:39] Barbara: What he just explained
[17/03/2025, 14:27:00] Barbara: What do you do when there are not many categories and also there is no order relation
[17/03/2025, 14:27:06] Maayan Sade: Wow, your profile picture looks like my sister's picture from far away
[17/03/2025, 14:27:11] Maayan Sade: And I didn't understand what she had to do with it
[17/03/2025, 14:27:12] Maayan Sade: Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
[17/03/2025, 14:27:25] Barbara: Because he said it's allowed to use fewer parameters when it's an ordinal category
[17/03/2025, 14:27:33] Maayan Sade: You do it normally, right?
[17/03/2025, 14:27:33] Barbara: Awesome
[17/03/2025, 14:27:35] Maayan Sade: You can ask
[17/03/2025, 14:27:42] Barbara: Could you ask, because I'm terribly shy
[17/03/2025, 14:27:48] Barbara: 🥺
[17/03/2025, 14:27:52] Barbara: Sorry
[17/03/2025, 14:27:54] Maayan Sade: Hahahahahahahahahahahaha
[17/03/2025, 14:27:57] Maayan Sade: After this
[17/03/2025, 14:27:59] Barbara: Cool
[17/03/2025, 14:28:00] Barbara: Thanks
[17/03/2025, 14:28:29] Maayan Sade: Say 3 categories of colors?
[17/03/2025, 14:28:41] Maayan Sade: I think you need to add 3 parameters
[17/03/2025, 14:28:47] Maayan Sade: Style one hot encoding
[17/03/2025, 14:29:09] Maayan Sade: In contrast, with order you can maybe do one X with one Beta but give a meaning that contains the order
[17/03/2025, 14:29:27] Maayan Sade: For example, first place will be 3, second place will be 2, and third place will be 1
[17/03/2025, 14:29:28] Maayan Sade: Like that
[17/03/2025, 14:29:31] Barbara: I get it
[17/03/2025, 14:29:31] Barbara: Cool
[17/03/2025, 14:29:56] Barbara: So in this case you need 3 parameters, and if it was ordered, it would be possible to manage with 2?
[17/03/2025, 14:33:42] Maayan Sade: I think in general you can manage with 2
[17/03/2025, 14:33:48] Maayan Sade: I'll explain to you after the Zoom
[17/03/2025, 14:42:02] Barbara: Okay, she's rambling, bless her
[17/03/2025, 14:42:08] Maayan Sade: Yes, she has to stop
[17/03/2025, 14:43:24] Barbara: I also thought so initially
[17/03/2025, 14:43:42] Barbara: But for some reason he said that you can only do that when the categorical variable is ordinal
[17/03/2025, 14:45:47] Maayan Sade: Sounds weird
[17/03/2025, 14:49:25] Barbara: There, Itay just explained :)))))
[17/03/2025, 14:49:28] Barbara: Yesssss
[17/03/2025, 14:49:33] Barbara: Finally I understood this crap hahah
[17/03/2025, 14:52:39] Maayan Sade: What are the conclusions
[17/03/2025, 14:52:46] Barbara: You're right
[17/03/2025, 14:52:50] Barbara: I guess I misunderstood him
[17/03/2025, 14:52:59] Maayan Sade: Ah, cool
[19/03/2025, 12:09:06] Maayan Sade: Where are you
[19/03/2025, 12:09:24] Barbara: audio omitted
[19/03/2025, 12:11:18] Barbara: audio omitted
[19/03/2025, 12:11:25] Barbara: audio omitted
[19/03/2025, 12:18:53] Maayan Sade: audio omitted
[19/03/2025, 12:24:43] Maayan Sade: https://youtu.be/ikuJ9HGqCBc?si=MKsoKtqfRVYHIY-o
[19/03/2025, 12:25:36] Maayan Sade: Representative
[19/03/2025, 14:24:41] Barbara: Hahahahahaha
[19/03/2025, 14:24:44] Barbara: Greattt
[19/03/2025, 14:24:51] Barbara: How did I not know this work of art?
[19/03/2025, 14:25:37] Maayan Sade: Yes, they sent it in CS memes, it's just amazing
[24/03/2025, 11:26:09] Maayan Sade: How's the grade???
[24/03/2025, 11:26:15] Barbara: I don't understand what's happening
[24/03/2025, 11:26:20] Barbara: I got a final grade of 57
[24/03/2025, 11:26:27] Maayan Sade: 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
[24/03/2025, 11:26:29] Barbara: Wait, wait
[24/03/2025, 11:26:35] Maayan Sade: Niceeee
[24/03/2025, 11:26:36] Barbara: Hold the celebrations
[24/03/2025, 11:26:38] Barbara: Noooo
[24/03/2025, 11:26:47] Barbara: I don't understand what's happening
[24/03/2025, 11:26:48] Maayan Sade: Hahahahahaha
[24/03/2025, 11:27:03] Barbara: If I passed the exam, the final grade should be much higher, right?
[24/03/2025, 11:27:13] Barbara: Like, factored in with homework and projects
[24/03/2025, 11:27:25] Maayan Sade: I have no idea
[24/03/2025, 11:27:39] Barbara: But if I didn't pass the exam, the grade should be much lower
[24/03/2025, 11:27:45] Barbara: Like, I don't understand at all what's happening
[24/03/2025, 11:27:46] Maayan Sade: I think what's showing is the final grade
[24/03/2025, 11:27:57] Barbara: But could they have made a mistake?
[24/03/2025, 11:28:24] Barbara: Like they added homework and projects even though I didn't pass the exam
[24/03/2025, 11:28:37] Maayan Sade: I don't know
[24/03/2025, 11:28:44] Barbara: But it's weird, right?
[24/03/2025, 11:28:51] Barbara: Did you pass?
[24/03/2025, 11:28:54] Maayan Sade: 51
[24/03/2025, 11:29:01] Barbara: Oh, ouch 🥺
[24/03/2025, 11:29:11] Maayan Sade: Calmly
[24/03/2025, 11:29:21] Maayan Sade: It's really surprising to me that it's that high
[24/03/2025, 11:29:33] Barbara: Well, you're studying for another year anyway
[24/03/2025, 11:29:46] Maayan Sade: I'm also thinking of extending my degree by another year
[24/03/2025, 11:29:55] Barbara: Good idea
[24/03/2025, 11:30:03] Barbara: Take fewer courses but more efficiently
[24/03/2025, 11:30:06] Barbara: Like with a high grade
[24/03/2025, 11:30:33] Maayan Sade: Yes
[24/03/2025, 11:30:45] Barbara: Ughhh I don't understand what's happening
[24/03/2025, 11:31:20] Barbara: If I passed or didn't pass and they accidentally added the protective grade for the assignments
[24/03/2025, 11:33:41] Maayan Sade: They said they added it even for those who didn't pass
[24/03/2025, 11:34:03] Maayan Sade: I, for example, got 4 questions right
[24/03/2025, 11:34:15] Maayan Sade: Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
[24/03/2025, 11:35:19] Maayan Sade: Which is 32 * 0.70 + 30
[24/03/2025, 11:35:27] Maayan Sade: Or a little less than 30, I don't have 100 on the assignments
[24/03/2025, 11:36:11] Barbara: I got five
[24/03/2025, 11:36:12] Barbara: Wow
[24/03/2025, 11:36:16] Maayan Sade: It looks like you got 4 right
[24/03/2025, 11:36:21] Maayan Sade: 5
[24/03/2025, 11:36:22] Maayan Sade: Yes
[24/03/2025, 11:36:36] Barbara: Wait, wait
[24/03/2025, 11:36:39] Barbara: Turns out there's also a factor
[24/03/2025, 11:36:45] Maayan Sade: ?
[24/03/2025, 11:36:46] Maayan Sade: Where
[24/03/2025, 11:36:48] Barbara: 🥲🥲🥲🥲
[31/03/2025, 9:11:34] Barbara: Maayan please replace me on Wednesday
[31/03/2025, 9:11:38] Barbara: I swear it's a super easy lesson
[31/03/2025, 9:11:57] Barbara: I already went over half of that lesson with them last week, just really need to practice with them, that's it
[31/03/2025, 9:12:10] Barbara: Compared to 11th grade (Yud-Aleph) the exercises are trivial
[31/03/2025, 9:23:13] Maayan Sade: I did the lesson
[31/03/2025, 9:23:18] Maayan Sade: But I have an exam on Friday 😖
[31/03/2025, 9:26:38] Barbara: I have an exam during the lesson
[31/03/2025, 9:26:45] Barbara: Pleassssse
[31/03/2025, 14:54:07] Maayan Sade: No, no way
[31/03/2025, 14:54:19] Maayan Sade: If you want to postpone it, I don't mind doing it for them after Friday at any time

[30/07/2025, 18:47:00] Maayan Sade: Sounds tough
[30/07/2025, 18:47:04] Maayan Sade: I was scared
[30/07/2025, 18:47:10] Barbara: What do you mean, they are truly the most perfect class in the program
[30/07/2025, 18:47:14] Barbara: Everyone says that
[30/07/2025, 18:47:21] Barbara: In Haifa
[30/07/2025, 18:47:25] Barbara: At Beit Rotenberg
[30/07/2025, 18:47:30] Barbara: If I drop

[30/07/2025, 18:47:52] Barbara: So I'm seriously considering it
[30/07/2025, 18:48:04] Barbara: I'm deeply in love with them
[30/07/2025, 18:48:16] Maayan Sade: audio omitted

[30/07/2025, 18:48:38] Barbara: Wait, you were planning on the Haifa 11th grade?

[30/07/2025, 18:54:15] Barbara: I was in 10th grade for the second year, I didn't need to prepare for the lessons at all
[30/07/2025, 18:54:30] Barbara: And if the class is good then it should really be easy
[30/07/2025, 18:54:39] Barbara: Especially if you only have 12th grade (Yud-Bet)
[30/07/2025, 18:54:47] Barbara: Okay

[31/07/2025, 10:55:13] Barbara: Statistics 1 or Introduction to Statistics?
[31/07/2025, 10:55:26] Barbara: Because they simply changed it one year and I think you took it according to the new guidelines
[31/07/2025, 12:34:07] Maayan Sade: Statistics 1 Statistics 2
[31/07/2025, 12:34:30] Barbara: Cool, thanks:)

[03/08/2025, 13:52:06] Barbara: Okay, I think I have an exam on the same day
[03/08/2025, 13:53:37] Maayan Sade: What
[03/08/2025, 13:54:02] Barbara: Enough, I've been to so many trainings, I'm really fed up already

[03/08/2025, 14:11:42] Barbara: What?
[03/08/2025, 15:34:47] Barbara: There's a training in Rosh HaAyin next Sunday, I'm coming with Ran. Want to come with us and share the gas cost?
[03/08/2025, 15:35:08] Barbara: Instead of 3 transfers, not including bus from home to the train station

[04/08/2025, 9:03:13] Barbara: Yes, we are splitting the gas between all of us, so you know hah
[04/08/2025, 9:03:53] Barbara: It just takes two effing hours to get there from Haifa, and I actually need to come from Acre… for me it turns into almost three hours of driving and I really don't want to
[04/08/2025, 10:03:22] Maayan Sade: There's no escaping it
[04/08/2025, 10:03:34] Maayan Sade: Not sure how yet
[04/08/2025, 10:03:36] Maayan Sade: Public transport we said is horrible
[04/08/2025, 10:03:37] Maayan Sade: ?

[04/08/2025, 10:39:45] Barbara: I tried, the camera decided not to open
[04/08/2025, 10:40:00] Barbara: And then Ben already booted out that guy

[09/08/2025, 23:47:02] Barbara: I certainly don't mind
[09/08/2025, 23:47:03] Maayan Sade: Cool
[09/08/2025, 23:47:07] Maayan Sade: HaHorsha 20
[09/08/2025, 23:47:12] Barbara: Cool

[09/08/2025, 23:47:32] Maayan Sade: When should I be ready?
[09/08/2025, 23:47:39] Barbara: 8:40 AM
[09/08/2025, 23:47:42] Maayan Sade: Locked in
[09/08/2025, 23:47:46] Barbara: audio omitted
[09/08/2025, 23:47:59] Maayan Sade: Cool
[09/08/2025, 23:48:02] Barbara: audio omitted
[09/08/2025, 23:48:03] Maayan Sade: So actually I'm not that much of a bother
[09/08/2025, 23:48:10] Maayan Sade: 😖
[09/08/2025, 23:48:16] Maayan Sade: I'll call when I wake up

[09/08/2025, 23:49:05] Barbara: Okay, at least something
[10/08/2025, 20:30:41] Maayan Sade: What's up
[19/08/2025, 10:42:54] Maayan Sade: Barbara
[19/08/2025, 10:43:04] Maayan Sade: I'm flying again during the semester (I think at least, maybe it's the holidays)
[19/08/2025, 10:43:13] Maayan Sade: 24-30.9
[19/08/2025, 10:45:21] Barbara: What does "again" mean
[19/08/2025, 10:45:28] Barbara: When are you flying again?
[19/08/2025, 10:45:33] Maayan Sade: 7-14/9
[19/08/2025, 10:45:50] Barbara: Ah, cool

[19/08/2025, 10:45:57] Maayan Sade: 25.8
[19/08/2025, 10:45:59] Maayan Sade: Hahahahahahahahaha
[19/08/2025, 10:46:01] Maayan Sade: Good morning, my life
[19/08/2025, 10:46:22] Maayan Sade: Like, we just need to be on top of the homework during those weeks, make sure we finish everything quickly
[19/08/2025, 10:51:34] Barbara: Stop it
[19/08/2025, 10:51:43] Maayan Sade: ❤
[19/08/2025, 10:51:45] Barbara: I'm having a mental breakdown from last semester
[19/08/2025, 10:51:56] Barbara: And from a project that isn't working for me at all, and I have 3 more
[19/08/2025, 10:52:03] Barbara: No problem
[19/08/2025, 10:52:07] Maayan Sade: 🫠🫠🫠
[19/08/2025, 10:52:21] Barbara: I'm on the material
[19/08/2025, 10:52:31] Barbara: I started studying already, don't get me wrong
[19/08/2025, 10:54:01] Maayan Sade: Woah, who is this
[19/08/2025, 10:54:03] Maayan Sade: That's a good idea
[19/08/2025, 10:56:10] Barbara: I just have no idea what is what
[19/08/2025, 10:56:22] Maayan Sade: Fair
[19/08/2025, 15:36:12] Barbara: Maayaannn
[19/08/2025, 15:36:17] Maayan Sade: ?
[19/08/2025, 15:36:26] Barbara: The gas came out to 15 NIS per direction
[19/08/2025, 15:36:29] Barbara: And the same for Itay
[19/08/2025, 15:36:35] Maayan Sade: Cool, transferring
[19/08/2025, 15:36:40] Barbara: At your convenience
[19/08/2025, 15:36:51] Barbara: I'm just sorting out all the reports now, and then I remembered
[19/08/2025, 15:36:54] Maayan Sade: Should I tell Itay too?
[19/08/2025, 15:36:57] Maayan Sade: Oh, smart
[19/08/2025, 15:37:07] Barbara: By the way, you report travel expenses according to the law
[19/08/2025, 15:37:10] Barbara: According to a daily free pass
[19/08/2025, 15:37:16] Maayan Sade: Yes...?
[19/08/2025, 15:37:18] Barbara: Yes, I'd appreciate it if you told Itay
[19/08/2025, 15:37:20] Barbara: Yeeessss
[19/08/2025, 15:37:22] Maayan Sade: Cool
[19/08/2025, 15:37:26] Barbara: Why doesn't anyone know about this??!!???
[19/08/2025, 15:37:32] Barbara: Like Ran didn't know either
[19/08/2025, 15:37:35] Barbara: And it's so strange
[19/08/2025, 15:37:43] Barbara: Of course they have to reimburse you if it cost you something to get there
[19/08/2025, 15:37:59] Barbara: It doesn't matter if you paid for gas or public transport
[19/08/2025, 15:38:20] Barbara: As long as there wasn't an organized transport, they have to pay you for travel
[19/08/2025, 15:45:56] Barbara: I checked for you along the way: 
Train + daily free public transport from Haifa to Rosh HaAyin comes out to 42 NIS
[19/08/2025, 15:46:21] Barbara: Same for Itay
[19/08/2025, 15:46:39] Maayan Sade: bhhc
[19/08/2025, 15:46:42] Maayan Sade: Nice
[28/08/2025, 10:40:24] Maayan Sade: Barbara
[28/08/2025, 10:40:27] Maayan Sade: What's the deal with statistics

[29/08/2025, 3:27:56] Barbara: audio omitted
[29/08/2025, 8:05:56] Maayan Sade: I didn't understand
[31/08/2025, 10:31:37] Maayan Sade: Anyway
[31/08/2025, 10:31:40] Maayan Sade: So what are we doing
[31/08/2025, 10:31:54] Maayan Sade: Today is statistics day
[31/08/2025, 10:32:05] Maayan Sade: Do you want us to sit down and divide the work?
[31/08/2025, 10:37:06] Barbara: I'm submitting 2 projects this week until Thursday so I'm not that available this specific week… S
[31/08/2025, 10:37:19] Barbara: Do the exercises you feel like doing
[31/08/2025, 10:37:25] Barbara: I'll do what's left on Friday
[31/08/2025, 10:37:28] Barbara: Cool?
[31/08/2025, 10:37:31] Barbara: This is a one-time thing
[31/08/2025, 10:37:33] Maayan Sade: It's due this Thursday isn't it?
[31/08/2025, 10:37:36] Barbara: No
[31/08/2025, 10:37:41] Barbara: I saw it's due next Sunday
[31/08/2025, 10:37:45] Maayan Sade: Ah cool
[31/08/2025, 10:37:50] Barbara: Check me
[31/08/2025, 10:37:56] Maayan Sade: Sure
[31/08/2025, 10:37:56] Barbara: I looked on Technion Plus
[31/08/2025, 10:38:02] Maayan Sade: If it's maximum this Thursday
[31/08/2025, 10:38:03] Barbara: And it showed it's until Sunday
[31/08/2025, 10:38:09] Maayan Sade: I can also do it alone
[31/08/2025, 10:38:17] Maayan Sade: And you can do the next one or something
[31/08/2025, 10:38:20] Barbara: Oh, and the week you're flying, I'll do it
[31/08/2025, 10:38:25] Barbara: Also an option
[31/08/2025, 10:38:31] Barbara: Cool, thanks for understanding sweetheart ❤️😅
[31/08/2025, 10:38:32] Maayan Sade: That's it
[31/08/2025, 10:38:35] Maayan Sade: Of course
[31/08/2025, 10:38:37] Barbara: I had two crazy weeks
[31/08/2025, 10:38:43] Maayan Sade: I'm flying next week simply
[31/08/2025, 10:38:45] Barbara: Anyway, keep me updated
[31/08/2025, 10:38:47] Barbara: Oh, good
[31/08/2025, 10:38:48] Maayan Sade: I wanted to make sure we're on it
[31/08/2025, 10:38:56] Barbara: So cool
[31/08/2025, 10:38:57] Maayan Sade: I'll check the submission time now
[31/08/2025, 10:39:09] Barbara: But still send me everything you submit later, I'll check too
[31/08/2025, 10:39:21] Barbara: So that Omer doesn't find anything to deduct points for
[31/08/2025, 10:39:24] Maayan Sade: Okay, I checked
[31/08/2025, 10:39:29] Maayan Sade: It's for Sunday
[31/08/2025, 10:39:30] Maayan Sade: But
[31/08/2025, 10:39:31] Barbara: Yes
[31/08/2025, 10:39:35] Maayan Sade: There's also the first project assignment
[31/08/2025, 10:39:37] Maayan Sade: Which is also for Sunday
[31/08/2025, 10:39:41] Barbara: Right
[31/08/2025, 10:39:49] Maayan Sade: So I'll sit on that
[31/08/2025, 10:39:50] Barbara: I'll sit on statistics Friday-Saturday
[31/08/2025, 10:39:54] Maayan Sade: And I'll probably leave you
[31/08/2025, 10:40:01] Maayan Sade: If I remember correctly, the first project assignment is EDA
[31/08/2025, 10:40:01] Barbara: Cool
[31/08/2025, 10:40:05] Barbara: Yes
[31/08/2025, 10:40:09] Barbara: Trivial
[31/08/2025, 10:40:12] Maayan Sade: Which doesn't challenge us
[31/08/2025, 10:40:17] Barbara: Hahahah
[31/08/2025, 10:40:24] Maayan Sade: Do you mind if I take the same topic as my previous partner and I did last semester?
[31/08/2025, 10:40:29] Maayan Sade: Because then there will be a reference for the project
[31/08/2025, 10:40:32] Maayan Sade: We got good grades
[31/08/2025, 10:40:40] Maayan Sade: If it's the same topics
[31/08/2025, 10:40:44] Barbara: audio omitted
[31/08/2025, 10:41:06] Barbara: I don't have a problem
[31/08/2025, 10:41:07] Maayan Sade: 👀
[31/08/2025, 10:41:09] Barbara: Take whatever you want
[31/08/2025, 10:41:13] Maayan Sade: So maybe yours is better
[31/08/2025, 10:41:16] Maayan Sade: What was the topic, do you remember?
[31/08/2025, 10:41:29] Barbara: audio omitted
[31/08/2025, 10:41:51] Barbara: audio omitted
[31/08/2025, 10:41:52] Maayan Sade: Ah
[31/08/2025, 10:42:02] Maayan Sade: Cool
[31/08/2025, 10:42:06] Maayan Sade: So I'll take whatever looks comfortable
[31/08/2025, 10:42:09] Maayan Sade: Hahahahahahahaha, cool
[31/08/2025, 10:42:29] Barbara: No problem, sweetheart
[31/08/2025, 10:42:35] Barbara: Wait, why aren't you with Itay actually?
[31/08/2025, 10:43:11] Maayan Sade: Because I arranged it with you before
[31/08/2025, 10:43:23] Barbara: Ahhhhh
[31/08/2025, 10:43:26] Barbara: How lucky am I, what is this
[31/08/2025, 10:43:39] Maayan Sade: Hahahahahahahaha
[31/08/2025, 10:43:41] Maayan Sade: ❤️
[05/09/2025, 8:39:14] Barbara: Hi, how are you?
[05/09/2025, 8:39:26] Barbara: How's it going?
[05/09/2025, 9:50:58] Maayan Sade: Good morning
[05/09/2025, 9:51:00] Maayan Sade: A little sick
[05/09/2025, 9:51:06] Maayan Sade: I pretty much finished week 1 in statistics
[05/09/2025, 9:51:26] Maayan Sade: The homework was almost the same as the winter semester, and the EDA project is chill
[05/09/2025, 10:24:49] Barbara: What grade did you get last year?
[05/09/2025, 10:25:14] Maayan Sade: 100
[05/09/2025, 10:25:24] Barbara: audio omitted
[05/09/2025, 10:25:28] Barbara: Niceeee
[05/09/2025, 10:26:43] Maayan Sade: I'll send it to you when I finish
[05/09/2025, 12:06:58] Barbara: Cool 🫶🏻

[05/09/2025, 15:43:07] Maayan Sade: I haven't finished yet
[05/09/2025, 15:43:13] Maayan Sade: Question 1 is still missing here
[05/09/2025, 15:43:25] Maayan Sade: But mainly I wanted you to look at what I'm doing in the project, tell me if it seems okay, too much or too little
[05/09/2025, 15:43:34] Maayan Sade: Because I'm not entirely sure what they want, and there are a million columns
[05/09/2025, 16:54:31] Barbara: I can do it
[05/09/2025, 16:54:45] Barbara: Anyway, I'll solve questions from the homework so it doesn't bother me
[05/09/2025, 16:55:26] Barbara: I think they want an in-depth EDA but be careful with rambling because he literally deducted points from me for elaborating too much and creating too many graphs
[05/09/2025, 16:55:46] Barbara: OMG please let Tzitzelsky have left already
[05/09/2025, 16:55:49] Barbara: I really can't deal with him
[05/09/2025, 16:56:09] Barbara: Anyway, I'll be home in the evening, I'll look and update if needed
[05/09/2025, 16:58:47] Maayan Sade: Worrying
[05/09/2025, 16:59:05] Maayan Sade: Are you sure? Because next week I probably won't be able to do anything abroad so it's a bit awkward
[05/09/2025, 16:59:19] Maayan Sade: Amennn
[05/09/2025, 16:59:26] Maayan Sade: Cool

[06/09/2025, 11:12:13] Maayan Sade: Barbaraaaha
[06/09/2025, 11:12:16] Maayan Sade: I need you to tell me
[06/09/2025, 12:15:54] Maayan Sade: Barbaraaaaaaah
[06/09/2025, 12:16:04] Maayan Sade: I also need to pack for the trip todayyyy, tell me what to doooo
[06/09/2025, 14:54:10] Maayan Sade: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/137d2bKOXYhZ_1qlmsmL8SsC1ZpxAR3g9?usp=sharing
[06/09/2025, 14:57:16] Maayan Sade: Okay I'll summarize the situation and what I need from you
[06/09/2025, 14:57:16] Maayan Sade: First, look at the features I chose, if they are okay, I took a total of I think 16 out of the million that were there.
[06/09/2025, 14:57:16] Maayan Sade: There are 2 I took, SurvyYr and AgeDecade, which I left simply because I had already done EDA on them before, I'm not sure they are really useful, I leave the decision to you.
[06/09/2025, 14:57:49] Maayan Sade: If you decide to remove one or both of them, just make sure you delete in the appropriate places:
In the place with the column title inside LOOKING AT THE COLUMNS, in the appropriate place inside INFO ABOUT RESULTING DF, and delete them inside the selection in the appropriate place in CHOOSING COLUMNS
[06/09/2025, 14:57:49] Maayan Sade: After that, go over the paragraph at the beginning which is almost completely GPT, and on the research questions at the end that I BS'd to verify that it is okay
[06/09/2025, 14:57:51] Maayan Sade: And that's generally it
[06/09/2025, 14:58:01] Maayan Sade: And verify that I didn't do something stupid or not good enough in the EDA
[06/09/2025, 14:58:02] Maayan Sade: ❤
[06/09/2025, 14:58:09] Maayan Sade: And put your ID there
[07/09/2025, 8:06:21] Maayan Sade: Yes? No? Maybe? Hahahahahahahahahaha
[07/09/2025, 10:33:18] Barbara: I'll do everythinggggg, sweetheart, have fun
[07/09/2025, 16:02:01] Maayan Sade: ❤️❤️❤️
[07/09/2025, 16:02:37] Barbara: I didn't know you type so well in Word
[07/09/2025, 16:02:47] Maayan Sade: I always type
[07/09/2025, 16:02:49] Barbara: I type everything in overleaf
[07/09/2025, 16:02:49] Maayan Sade: My English
[07/09/2025, 16:02:52] Maayan Sade: My partner's Hebrew
[07/09/2025, 16:02:55] Barbara: image omitted
[07/09/2025, 16:03:01] Maayan Sade: Who got about 100 in the course
[07/09/2025, 16:03:12] Maayan Sade: Wow, teach me please
[07/09/2025, 16:03:33] Barbara: No problem, sweetheart
[07/09/2025, 16:03:40] Barbara: We'll do a homework assignment together once

[07/09/2025, 23:36:03] Barbara: I cleaned it up so it took a little time
[07/09/2025, 23:36:10] Barbara: Omer will deduct grades for no reason
[07/09/2025, 23:36:10] Maayan Sade: What was really needed
[07/09/2025, 23:36:15] Maayan Sade: Screw him
[07/09/2025, 23:36:20] Barbara: So I'm trying to reduce his options for deduction
[07/09/2025, 23:36:36] Barbara: Of courseeee

[11/09/2025, 19:55:55] Barbara: Anyway, when are you coming back, sweetheart?
[11/09/2025, 19:56:05] Barbara: I'm starting to do Homework 3 in the meantime because there's no choice....

[11/09/2025, 20:08:54] Maayan Sade: Wow, these flights will be the death of me, huh
[11/09/2025, 20:09:07] Maayan Sade: I hope he shows some mercy during the holidays
[11/09/2025, 20:09:16] Barbara: I hope for your sake
[11/09/2025, 20:09:22] Barbara: Because it's hard to catch up
[11/09/2025, 20:09:22] Maayan Sade: Yes
[11/09/2025, 20:09:25] Maayan Sade: Yes, exactly
[11/09/2025, 20:09:30] Maayan Sade: But in October I'm completely free
[11/09/2025, 20:09:33] Maayan Sade: I'll do a marathon on everything
[11/09/2025, 20:09:35] Barbara: Wow, you also have 12th grade (Yud-Bet)
[11/09/2025, 20:09:37] Barbara: Death
[11/09/2025, 20:09:38] Maayan Sade: Maybe I'll even redo some of the homework
[11/09/2025, 20:09:40] Maayan Sade: Yes
[11/09/2025, 20:09:50] Maayan Sade: But honestly, it's fewer hours
[11/09/2025, 20:09:52] Barbara: It's highly recommended
[11/09/2025, 20:09:59] Maayan Sade: Max 6 per week

[11/09/2025, 20:10:50] Maayan Sade: And then the weekend is free

[11/09/2025, 20:12:42] Maayan Sade: Okay, a little too much
[11/09/2025, 20:12:44] Maayan Sade: 4 is a lot

[13/09/2025, 14:57:42] Barbara: It's all goodddd
[13/09/2025, 14:57:48] Barbara: Number 4 is easy, honestly
[13/09/2025, 14:57:58] Barbara: And it also forces me to actually go over the lectures and tutorials
[13/09/2025, 14:58:02] Barbara: 😅😅😅😅
[13/09/2025, 14:58:11] Maayan Sade: Okay

[15/09/2025, 14:55:11] Maayan Sade: Take a vacation
[15/09/2025, 14:55:14] Barbara: Isn't it a shame about the money?
[15/09/2025, 14:55:19] Maayan Sade: Why
[15/09/2025, 14:55:21] Barbara: Like, I'm not asking about submissions
[15/09/2025, 14:55:21] Maayan Sade: 5 days

[15/09/2025, 14:55:58] Maayan Sade: Don't need 100

[15/09/2025, 14:56:42] Barbara: Okay, I'm also doing Statistics 1 so I'm stressed
[15/09/2025, 14:56:47] Barbara: So it makes sense that you're more relaxed
[15/09/2025, 14:56:53] Barbara: It makes logical sense to me now hah

Part A: Question 7, it's unclear why a T-test and not a Wald test -5 Question 8: Partial, what you did in section 5 is not enough. -5
[20/09/2025, 13:55:35] Barbara: Please update me when you're on it because I'm really stressed these next two weeks
[20/09/2025, 14:04:26] Maayan Sade: What
[20/09/2025, 14:04:50] Maayan Sade: Ah like a converter
[20/09/2025, 14:05:01] Maayan Sade: I usually just search on Google for a site that converts but I'm cool with that too hahahahahahaha

I was and still am a little sick so it's delaying me, but I believe it will be fine, and in the worst case, I'll work on it abroad
[20/09/2025, 14:06:32] Maayan Sade: I'll update
[20/09/2025, 14:06:43] Maayan Sade: But yes, I'm on it, you can focus on other things ❤️

[20/09/2025, 20:18:35] Maayan Sade: I remember something about them running the file we submitted in part 1
[20/09/2025, 20:18:45] Maayan Sade: Do you have it by any chance? Or should I just extract it from the code
[20/09/2025, 20:18:53] Maayan Sade: Just to make sure I'm consistent
[20/09/2025, 20:19:00] Barbara: Voice call, 4 min

[23/09/2025, 23:22:13] Maayan Sade: partA7 - check explanation for t-test, also make sure i didn't mess up there im not confidant, same with partA8
PARTA10 - not sure which data to use here,same with partB7+8, i just used the full set as it seemed the most logical

[12/10/2025, 13:32:09] Maayan Sade: But my life, I said I would do parts 4 and 5, didn't you say you were busy? 🫠

[20/10/2025, 8:50:05] Maayan Sade: About that, I'll do it anyway as a revision for the exam, but in total we need 5/6 homeworks because we get 100 on all of them and they take the score of the highest 5, right?
[20/10/2025, 8:50:11] Maayan Sade: And I don't think so

[20/10/2025, 13:15:31] Barbara: It's not right because he did check Homework 4 so it's really weird
